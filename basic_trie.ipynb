    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\(O(m)\\)\n",
    "  - Here, \\(m\\) is the length of the word being inserted.\n",
    "  - For each character in the word, we check if it exists in the current node’s `children` dictionary. If not, we add a new `TrieNode`. This process takes \\(O(1)\\) for each character, resulting in a total time complexity of \\(O(m)\\) for inserting a word of length \\(m\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\(O(m)\\)\n",
    "  - In the worst case, where no characters in the word overlap with existing entries, we need to create a new `TrieNode` for each character. Therefore, the space complexity is proportional to the length of the word being inserted, which is \\(O(m)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Search (`search`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\(O(m)\\)\n",
    "  - Here, \\(m\\) is the length of the word being searched.\n",
    "  - We iterate through each character in the word, navigating through the `children` dictionary. Each character lookup takes \\(O(1)\\), resulting in a total time complexity of \\(O(m)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\(O(1)\\)\n",
    "  - No additional space is used beyond the existing Trie structure, as we're only traversing nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Prefix Search (`startsWith`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\(O(m)\\)\n",
    "  - Here, \\(m\\) is the length of the prefix.\n",
    "  - Similar to the `search` function, we iterate through each character in the prefix, performing \\(O(1)\\) operations for each character lookup, resulting in a time complexity of \\(O(m)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\(O(1)\\)\n",
    "  - This operation only requires traversal, so no extra space is needed.\n",

    "### Notes\n",
    "- The space complexity of the Trie as a whole depends on the total number of unique characters across all words. If \\(n\\) is the number of words inserted and each word has a maximum length of \\(m\\), the Trie could require up to \\(O(n $\\cdot$ m)\\) space in the worst case (if all characters in all words are unique).\n",

    "This Trie implementation is efficient for operations involving a dictionary of words, especially when performing multiple prefix searches, as it allows efficient lookups and prefix checks."
